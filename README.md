# Linear-Regression-Analysis
Linear Rgression Analysis to Predict the Change in Resistance Based on Temperature:
 a linear regression model is trained to predict the change in resistance (delR) based on temperature (TC). 
 The actual and predicted values are then plotted for comparison, and the predicted data is saved to an Excel file. 
 You can similarly integrate other machine learning techniques or tasks as needed in the rest of your code.
 Remember to import the necessary libraries and adjust the code accordingly to match your specific requirements.
